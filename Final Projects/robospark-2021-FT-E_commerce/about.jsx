Flipkart was founded in October 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT, Delhi and former Amazon employees.[11][12][13] The company initially focused on online book sales with country-wide shipping. Flipkart slowly grew in prominence and was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.[14] In 2010, Flipkart acquired the Bangalore-based social book discovery service WeRead from Lulu.com.[15]

Partnerships and acquisitions
Acquisitions
In 2011, Flipkart acquired the digital distribution business Mime360.com[16] and the digital content library of the Bollywood portal Chakpak.[17] Following this acquisition, Flipkart launched their DRM-free online music store Flyte in 2012. Because of competition from free streaming sites, the site was unsuccessful and shut down in June 2013.[18][19][20][21]

With its eyes on India's retail market, Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer,[22] in 2012, and Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for $280 million in May 2014.[23] Myntra continues to operate alongside Flipkart as a standalone subsidiary focusing on separate market segments.[24] In April 2015, Flipkart acquired Appiterate, a Delhi-based mobile marketing automation firm. Flipkart stated that it would use Appiterate's technology to enhance its mobile services.[25] In December 2015, Flipkart purchased a minority stake in the digital mapping provider MapmyIndia.[26] In 2016, Flipkart acquired the online fashion retailer Jabong.com from Rocket Internet for $70 million and the UPI mobile payments startup PhonePe.[27][28] In January 2017, Flipkart made a $2 million investment in TinyStep, a parenting information startup.[29] Flipkart invested $35 million in Arvind Fashions Limited's newly formed subsidiary Arvind Youth Brands for a 27% stake in the company. Arvind Youth Brands owns Flying Machine.[30]

Flipkart Wholesale recently launched a digital platform for kiranas and MSMEs.[31] In October 2020, Flipkart acquired a 7.8% stake in Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail for $204 million.[32][33]
